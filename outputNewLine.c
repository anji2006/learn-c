       The newline character (\n) is called an escape sequence, and it forces the cursor to 
    change its position to the beginning of the next line on the screen.This results in a new line.


     ==> Examples of other valid escape sequences are:--
        \t   -----> Create a Tab
        \\ -------> Inserts a backslash (\)
        \" -------> Inserts a double quotes (")
